# Linux File System
## 1. Introduction to the Linux File System

### 1.1. What is the Linux File System?
Linux has a unique way of organizing things: **"Everything is a file."** This means that not only documents and programs but also folders, hardware (like your USB drive), and even communication channels are treated as files. This makes it easier for Linux to manage everything in a consistent way.

To see what files and folders look like, use this command in the terminal:

```sh
ls -l
```

**Example Output:**

```
drwxr-xr-x  2 user user 4096 Mar 09 12:00 Documents
-rw-r--r--  1 user user 1234 Mar 09 12:34 file.txt
```

- `d` = directory (a folder).
- `-` = regular file (like a text file).
- The numbers and words after that show who owns it, its size, and when it was last changed.

**Try It:** Open a terminal, type `ls -l`, and look at your files!

---

### 1.2. Types of Files in Linux
Linux files come in different types. Here’s a detailed list with examples:

| **File Type**      | **Symbol** | **What It Is**                          | **Example**         |
|-------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Regular File**  | `-`        | Normal files (text, images, programs).  | `file.txt`          |
| **Directory**     | `d`        | Folders that hold other files.          | `Documents/`        |
| **Character Device** | `c`     | Hardware that sends data bit-by-bit (e.g., keyboard). | `/dev/tty` |
| **Block Device**  | `b`        | Hardware that sends data in chunks (e.g., USB drive). | `/dev/sda` |
| **Symbolic Link** | `l`        | A shortcut to another file.             | `shortcut -> file.txt` |

**How to Check:**

```sh
ls -l /dev/sda  # Shows "b" for block device
file myfile.txt # Tells you it’s a text file
```

**Try It:** Type `ls -l /dev` to see device files on your system.

### 1.3. How Linux Organizes Files

Linux organizes files in a **tree-like structure**, starting from the **root directory**, written as `/`. Think of it like an upside-down tree: the root (`/`) is at the top, and branches (directories) spread out below it. Every file and folder in Linux has a unique path starting from `/`, which makes it easy to find anything.

#### Why It’s a Tree
This structure keeps things organized. For example:
- Programs are in one place (`/bin`).
- Your personal files are in another (`/home`).
- Hardware info is separate (`/dev`).

Let’s break it down with details, examples, and commands you can try.

---

#### Key Directories in the Linux Tree
Here’s a detailed table of the most important directories, what they hold, and why they matter:

| **Folder** | **What’s Inside**                          | **Why It Matters**                  | **Example Command**         |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `/`        | The root directory, the start of everything. | All paths begin here.              | `ls /`                     |
| `/bin`     | Basic programs (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, `cat`).  | Tools you use daily.               | `ls /bin`                  |
| `/sbin`    | System programs (e.g., `reboot`, `fsck`).  | For managing the system (admins).  | `ls /sbin`                 |
| `/home`    | User folders (e.g., `/home/user`).         | Your personal space.               | `cd /home && ls`           |
| `/dev`     | Device files (e.g., `/dev/sda` for disks). | Links to hardware.                 | `ls /dev`                  |
| `/etc`     | Configuration files (e.g., `passwd`).      | Controls how Linux behaves.        | `cat /etc/passwd`          |
| `/tmp`     | Temporary files.                           | Cleared on reboot—good for tests.  | `touch /tmp/testfile`      |
| `/usr`     | User programs and libraries.               | Extra software you install.        | `ls /usr/bin`              |
| `/lib`     | Libraries for programs (e.g., `.so` files).| Helps programs run.                | `ls /lib`                  |
| `/mnt`     | Mount points for devices (e.g., USBs).     | Where you connect external drives. | `ls /mnt`                  |
| `/root`    | Home folder for the root user.             | Admin’s personal space.            | (Needs sudo to access)     |
| `/var`     | Variable data (e.g., logs, mail).          | Stores changing info.              | `ls /var/log`              |

#### How Files Get Organized
Linux puts files in specific places for a reason:
1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - System files (e.g., `/bin`, `/etc`) are separate from user files (`/home`).
   - This keeps your stuff safe if the system updates or crashes.

2. **Standard Layout**:
   - Most Linux systems (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.) use this structure.
   - Example: If you install a game, it might go to `/usr/games`.

3. **Mounting Devices**:
   - External drives (like USBs) attach to the tree at `/mnt` or `/media`.
   - Example: Plug in a USB, and it might appear as `/mnt/usb`.

**Command to See the Tree:**

```sh
tree / -L 1  # Shows the top level (needs "tree" installed: sudo apt install tree)
```

**Sample Output:**

```
/
├── bin
├── dev
├── etc
├── home
└── tmp
```

---

#### Practical Examples
1. **Finding a Program:**
   - Want to use `ls`? It’s in `/bin/ls`.

   ```sh
   /bin/ls /home  # Runs "ls" to list your home folder
   ```

2. **Checking Logs:**
   - System logs are in `/var/log`.

   ```sh
   cat /var/log/syslog  # Shows system activity (might need sudo)
   ```

3. **Adding a File:**
   - Create a file in your home folder:

   ```sh
   touch /home/user/myfile.txt  # Makes an empty file
   ```

4. **Mounting a USB:**
   - List devices:

   ```sh
   lsblk  # Shows /dev/sdb1 (example)
   ```
   
   - Mount it:

   ```sh
   sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
   ls /mnt  # See USB contents
   ```

### 1.4. File Permissions (Who Can Use a File?)
Linux decides who can **read (r)**, **write (w)**, or **execute (x)** a file. There are three groups:
- **Owner (u)**: The person who created it.
- **Group (g)**: A team of users.
- **Others (o)**: Everyone else.

**Example:**

```
-rwxr-xr--  1 user user 1234 Mar 09 12:34 file.txt
```

- `-rwxr-xr--` splits into 3 parts:
  - `rwx` (Owner): Can read, write, and run (7 = 4+2+1).
  - `r-x` (Group): Can read and run (5 = 4+1).
  - `r--` (Others): Can only read (4).

**Numbers Explained:**
- `r` = 4 (read)
- `w` = 2 (write)
- `x` = 1 (execute)
- Add them up: `rwx` = 7, `r-x` = 5, `r--` = 4.

#### Changing Permissions with `chmod`

```sh
chmod 755 file.txt  # Owner: rwx (7), Group & Others: r-x (5)
chmod u+w file.txt  # Add write for owner
chmod g-r file.txt  # Remove read for group
```

#### Changing Owners with `chown`

```sh
chown newuser file.txt        # Give file to "newuser"
chown newuser:group file.txt  # Set owner and group
```

**Try It:** Create a file with `touch test.txt`, then run `ls -l test.txt` to see its permissions.

---

### 1.5. Managing Disks
#### Check Disk Space

```sh
df -h  # Shows free space in human-readable form (e.g., GB)
```

**Example Output:**

```
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1       20G   10G   10G  50% /
```

#### Check Folder Size

```sh
du -sh myfolder  # Shows size of "myfolder" (e.g., 2.5M)
```

#### Connect (Mount) a USB Drive
1. Plug in your USB.
2. Find its name:

   ```sh
   lsblk  # Lists devices, e.g., /dev/sdb1
   ```
   
3. Mount it:

   ```sh
   sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
   ```
   
4. Unmount it when done:

   ```sh
   sudo umount /mnt
   ```

**Try It:** Run `df -h` and check how much space your disk has left.

### 1.6. Types of File Systems
A **file system** is how Linux stores data on a disk. Here’s a beginner’s guide:

| **Type** | **What It’s For**                  | **When You See It**      |
|----------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **ext4** | Default for Linux, very reliable.  | Your main Linux drive.   |
| **vfat** | Works with Windows (FAT32).        | USB drives.              |
| **ntfs** | For Windows hard drives.           | External drives.         |

**Check Your File System:**
```sh
df -T  # Shows types (e.g., ext4, vfat)
```

**Try It:** Run `df -T` and find out what type your `/` (root) uses.

---

### 1.7. Special Folders: `/proc` and `/sys`
These folders don’t store real files—they show live info about your system.

- **`/proc`**: System and process details.

  ```sh
  cat /proc/cpuinfo  # Shows your CPU (e.g., Intel or ARM)
  cat /proc/meminfo  # Shows RAM usage
  ```

- **`/sys`**: Hardware info.

  ```sh
  ls /sys/class/net  # Lists network devices (e.g., eth0)
  ```

**Try It:** Run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` and find your CPU’s name.

## 2. Working with Files

### 2.1. Basic File Commands
Linux uses **system calls** (instructions) to work with files. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

| **Command** | **What It Does**            | **Example Use**            |
|-------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| `open()`    | Opens a file to use it.     | Open "test.txt" to write.  |
| `read()`    | Reads data from a file.     | Read text from "test.txt". |
| `write()`   | Writes data to a file.      | Write "Hello" to a file.   |
| `close()`   | Closes a file when done.    | Finish using "test.txt".   |

#### Example: Writing "Hello" to a File

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    int fd = open("hello.txt", O_RDWR | O_CREAT, 0644); // Open or create file
    if (fd < 0) {
        printf("Error opening file!\n");
        return 1;
    }
    write(fd, "Hello\n", 6);  // Write "Hello" + newline
    close(fd);               // Close the file
    return 0;
}
```

- **Steps:**
  1. `open()` creates `hello.txt` with permissions `0644` (rw-r--r--).
  2. `write()` adds "Hello".
  3. `close()` finishes the job.

**Try It:** Save this code as `write.c`, compile with `gcc write.c -o write`, and run `./write`. Check `hello.txt`!

## 3. File Management

### 3.1. What is Page Cache?
The **page cache** speeds up your system by keeping file data in RAM (fast memory) instead of always reading from the disk (slow).

- **Reading**: 
  - If data is in cache, Linux uses it (fast).
  - If not, it loads it from disk to cache, then uses it.
- **Writing**: 
  - Data goes to cache first.
  - Later, it’s saved to disk.

**Force Save to Disk:**

```sh
sync         # Saves all cached data
fsync hello.txt  # Saves just "hello.txt" (needs programming)
```

**Try It:** Write to a file, then run `sync` to ensure it’s saved.

---

### 3.2. How Linux Tracks Files
Linux uses three tables to manage files. Here’s a detailed explanation:

1. **I-node Table**: Stores file details (not the name).
   - Example: Size, permissions, where data is on disk.
   - **Look Up:** `ls -i file.txt` shows its i-node number.

2. **Open File Table**: Tracks files that are open.
   - Example: Where you’re reading/writing in the file.
   - Shared across the system.

3. **File Descriptor Table**: Each program gets its own list of numbers (file descriptors) to use files.
   - Example: `fd 0` = input, `fd 1` = output.

#### Opening a File (Step-by-Step):
1. You run: `open("test.txt", O_RDWR)`.
2. Linux finds `test.txt`’s i-node.
3. Adds an entry to the Open File Table.
4. Gives your program a number (e.g., `fd = 3`).
5. You use `fd` to read/write.

**Try It:** Run `cat test.txt` and think about how Linux finds it.

## 4. File Locking

### 4.1. What is File Locking?
File locking keeps programs from changing a file at the same time. It’s like locking a door so only one person can use it.

---

### 4.2. Two Ways to Lock Files

#### 1. `flock()`: Simple Locking
- Locks the whole file.
- Two types:
  - **Shared (LOCK_SH)**: Many can read.
  - **Exclusive (LOCK_EX)**: Only one can write.

**Example:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/file.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

int main() {
    int fd = open("test.txt", O_RDWR);
    if (fd < 0) {
        printf("Error opening file!\n");
        return 1;
    }
    flock(fd, LOCK_EX);  // Lock it
    printf("File locked! Waiting 5 seconds...\n");
    sleep(5);            // Hold for 5 seconds
    flock(fd, LOCK_UN);  // Unlock it
    printf("File unlocked.\n");
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```

#### 2. `fcntl()`: Flexible Locking
- Locks parts of a file or the whole thing.
- More control, but trickier.

**Example:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    int fd = open("test.txt", O_RDWR);
    if (fd < 0) {
        printf("Error opening file!\n");
        return 1;
    }
    struct flock lock = {F_WRLCK, SEEK_SET, 0, 0}; // Write lock, whole file
    fcntl(fd, F_SETLK, &lock);  // Set lock
    printf("File locked! Waiting 5 seconds...\n");
    sleep(5);
    lock.l_type = F_UNLCK;      // Unlock
    fcntl(fd, F_SETLK, &lock);
    printf("File unlocked.\n");
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```

**Try It:** Save both examples, compile them (`gcc file.c -o file`), and run them. Open two terminals and see how one waits!
