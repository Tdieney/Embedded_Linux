# Embedded Linux Programming

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Embedded Linux Programming** repository! This repository is created to document and organize the knowledge, notes, and homework assignments related to the Embedded Linux course. It serves as a centralized resource for learning, reviewing, and sharing insights gained throughout the course.

The course focuses on key concepts of Embedded Linux, including system programming, kernel development, device drivers, and network programming (e.g., Sockets). This repository will include detailed notes, code snippets, and solutions to homework assignments to aid in understanding and applying these concepts.

## Purpose

The main goals of this repository are:
- To **document knowledge** acquired during the Embedded Linux course, including theoretical concepts, practical examples, and best practices.
- To **store homework solutions** and exercises, providing a reference for future review and improvement.
- To serve as a **learning resource** for anyone interested in Embedded Linux, offering structured notes and hands-on examples.
- To encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing among peers by maintaining an organized and accessible repository.
